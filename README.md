This is a collection of python3 scripts to automate some silly(not for me) and boring stuffs I've faced to live hassle-free.
OS: Ubuntu  18.04
Boring_files_mover.py:
I've added this script to cronjob of OS( Ubuntu 18.04) for cleansing noise files(which are not applicable for wallpaper) to another directory. It automatically runs everyday at certain time to move unnecessary files and rename suitable files.
Take_screenshot.py:
Due to some stubborn problem of OS, I had to write this script to take screenshot to specified directory(which was the problem from my OS.)
To run- 
step 1: make the Take_screenshot.py file executable. [ex: chmod 755 Take_screenshot.py]
step 2: Specify the folder path.
step 3: add a shortcut key from your operating system's keyboard hotkeys.
